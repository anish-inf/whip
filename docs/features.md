# Features

loopy is a minimal coding-agent harness: an interactive bubbletea TUI driving an
LLM tool-use loop (bash / read / write / edit / task) with provider-routable
models. This document is the map of what's shipped and where it lives. Each
section links the behavior to the code and its tests.

## The agent loop

`internal/agent/agent.go` — `Agent.Turn` is the loop: append the user message,
stream a completion, run any tool calls, append results, repeat until the model
stops calling tools. Steered messages (`Steer`) inject at loop boundaries,
never mid-generation.

### Parallel tool calls with per-path file locks

When the model emits several tool calls in one turn, `runTools` fans them out
to goroutines and collects results on a buffered channel, laid back out in
**call order** (the API matches tool results to call IDs). `OnToolStart` /
`OnToolEnd` fire per call as they run, so the UI shows each tool live.

`internal/agent/filelocks.go` — mutations to the same file serialize through a
**per-canonical-path channel semaphore** (a 1-capacity `chan struct{}` per
path: send to acquire, receive to release). Two edits to `foo.go` can't
interleave; edits to different files run truly in parallel. `bash` takes a
global lock because a command's side effects aren't attributable to one path.
Reads don't lock.

This is the Go-native port of pi's `withFileMutationQueue` (per-path promise
chains in TypeScript). In Go the lock is a buffered channel — no explicit
unlock bookkeeping.

Tests: `parallel_test.go` — `TestToolCallsRunInParallel` (overlap measured via
a concurrency counter), `TestSamePathEditsSerialize`, `TestToolMutationPath`,
`TestCanonicalPathKey`.

### Compaction

When the conversation fills the context window, old turns fold into an
LLM-generated summary. Two triggers:

- **Proactive**: `maybeCompact` runs before each request once the estimated
  token count crosses 90% of the advertised context window.
- **Reactive**: if the provider still rejects a request with a context-limit
  error (`context_length_exceeded`, `prompt_too_long`, HTTP 413), `Turn`
  compacts once and retries. A `compacted` guard prevents retry loops.

`compact()` keeps the system prompt and a recent tail, and is **orphan-safe**:
a kept tail that begins with a `tool`-role message walks back to its owning
assistant message so no tool result references an erased call ID. The summary
runs as a non-streaming `Complete` on the conversation's model, or on a
dedicated compaction model if configured (`compactModel` / `compactProvider`).

Token bookkeeping: `llm.Usage` (prompt/completion/cached) is read off the
terminal stream chunk (`stream_options: include_usage`) and folded into session
totals via `AddUsage`. Compaction and subagent calls count too.

Commands: `/compact` (compact now), `/compact <model> [provider]` (pick the
summarizer), `/compact off` (clear the override).

Tests: `agent_test.go` — `TestTurnAutoCompactsOnContextLimit`,
`TestCompactDoesNotLoopOnRepeatedContextLimit`, `TestCompactKeepsToolCallPair`,
`TestProactiveCompactAtNinetyPercent`, `TestUsageAccumulates`.

### Background subagents

`internal/agent/background.go` — `task` with `background: true` launches a
subagent that runs **concurrently with the parent** instead of blocking the
turn. This is the channel-native port of opencode's `background-job.ts`
registry.

Each task is a `BackgroundTask` with a `Done chan struct{}`. When the subagent
settles, the registry `settle()`s and **closes `Done` once** — closing a
channel broadcasts to every waiter at once, so the tool caller, the TUI, and
`/tasks` all wake together with no per-waiter state (opencode needs a per-job
`Deferred` for the same thing). On settle the report fans back into the parent
as a **steered message**, so the model sees it on the next loop boundary.

- `Tasks().List()` / `Get(id)` / `Cancel(id)` — registry snapshot + cancel.
- `Tasks().OnChange` — the TUI installs a callback that sends a message to
  redraw live.
- `/tasks` lists running/done tasks with report previews; a `⚙ N bg` header
  badge shows the running count.

Background tasks use a context **not** tied to the current turn — they outlive
it by design. Cancelling a task cancels its subagent's turn.

Tests: `TestBackgroundTaskDeliversReport`, `TestBackgroundTaskBroadcastsToManyWaiters`
(8 waiters all woken by one channel close), `TestBackgroundTaskCancel`.

## Models & providers

`internal/config/config.go`, `internal/config/catalog.go` — models route to
providers; the provider's `GET /models` is the source of truth for
capabilities. Two distinct limits, both honored:

- **Context window (input)** — `Model.Context` (legacy `maxTokens` still
  parses via `ContextWindow()`), overridden by the provider's
  `context_length`. Drives the header's `% ctx` and proactive compaction.
- **Output cap** — `Model.MaxOut`, else the provider's `max_completion_tokens`,
  else the context window. Sent as the request's `max_tokens`.

The catalog (`~/.loopy/models.json`) caches each provider's model list with a
24h TTL and refreshes in the background.

`internal/llm/openai.go` — the streaming client. Typed `HTTPError` (keeps the
`<status>: <body>` shape), `IsContextLimit()` classifies context-overflow
errors for the compaction retry, `Stream` returns the message + usage, and
`Complete` is the non-streaming round-trip used by compaction.

## The TUI

`internal/tui/tui.go` — bubbletea fullscreen alt-screen. Highlights:

- **ctrl+c is a two-stage key.** While busy it interrupts the turn (first press
  arms, second cancels). While idle it quits — but only on a **second press
  within a 2-second window**, so a stray ctrl+c can't nuke the session. The
  hint `press ctrl+c again to quit` shows while armed.
  Tests: `quit_confirm_test.go`.
- **Collapsible tool results.** Tool results store raw output in a `blockTool`
  transcript block and render collapsed to 5 lines with a `… +N lines` hint.
  `ctrl+e` toggles the most recent; clicking a block expands/collapses it
  (each block tracks its rendered line range `y0`/`y1` so the click row maps
  through the viewport offset). Blocks re-render at the current width on
  terminal resize. Tests: `tool_expand_test.go`, `resize_test.go`.
- **Markdown.** Assistant messages render through glamour; streamed in-flight
  text stays plain and renders on flush. `markdown.go`.
- **Command palette** (ctrl+p) with sub-panels for model/effort/goal/compaction
  — `palette.go`.
- **Mouse**: `/mouse` toggles capture; with capture off the terminal's native
  selection works, with it on shift-drag selects. `"mouse": false` in config
  disables capture at startup.
- Queueing (enter while busy), steering (empty enter), history recall (↑/↓),
  `@file` mentions, `$skill` invocation, `/goal` loop, `/resume` session
  picker, `/effort` reasoning levels — see the roadmap for the full list.

## MCP

`internal/mcp/` — loopy is an MCP client (stdio + streamable HTTP) and, via
`loopy mcp serve`, an MCP server. Three sources of server config merge with
loopy's own on top (per-name, whole entry): a project `.mcp.json`
(claude-style: `{"mcpServers": {name: {type, command, args, env, url,
headers}}}`), `~/.codex/config.toml` `[mcp_servers.*]` (codex-style), and the
`"mcp"` block in `~/.loopy/config.json`. Claude `type: sse` imports as
disabled-with-note (legacy transport); `${VAR}` references in env/headers
expand from loopy's environment.

- **Manager** (`manager.go`) — one lifecycle goroutine per server; a
  `ready chan struct{}` closes once on first settle (the BackgroundTask
  close-to-broadcast pattern), so tool calls block only on *their* server and
  startup never waits. Statuses: connecting → ready/failed (plus disabled);
  a dropped session flips to failed via a generation-guarded watcher
  (opencode's client-identity check, `mcp/index.ts:443`). Connect/list bounded
  by `startupTimeout` (default 30s — opencode's DEFAULT_TIMEOUT).
- **Tool bridge** — listed tools become agent tools named
  `mcp__<server>__<tool>` (claude-code convention; double underscores keep
  the split unambiguous since tool names contain `_`). Unsafe server-name
  chars get an fnv hash suffix so sanitized names can't collide (an opencode
  weakness). Calls serialize per server (1-cap channel — many stdio servers
  are single-request), run under `toolTimeout` (default 60s), and respect
  ctrl+c via ctx. Results flatten to text: images/audio/binary resources →
  placeholders, `structuredContent` → JSON when there's no text, `IsError` →
  `"Error: …"` fed back to the model — a broken MCP tool never kills a turn.
  Output capped at the shared 50KB truncation. MCP tools take no file locks
  and run in parallel with everything.
- **Late arrivals** — `Manager.SetOnChange` pushes refreshed tool sets into
  `Agent.SetMCPTools` (mutex-guarded; a settle mid-turn can't race the slice
  a request reads), so a server connecting after turn 1 appears without a
  restart.
- **TUI** — `/mcp` shows the status table (`● N tools` / `✗ err` /
  `○ disabled` / `◌ connecting…`); `/mcp <name> reconnect|enable|disable`
  reconnects live or persists a toggle through the guarded `Config.Save`.
- **CLI** — `loopy mcp list` (merged view with source labels), `loopy mcp
  add <name> -- <cmd...>` / `--url`, `loopy mcp remove`. `loopy mcp serve`
  (`serve.go`) exposes loopy's read/bash/edit/write as an MCP stdio server
  for other harnesses.
- **Shutdown** — `Manager.Close()` runs before `bashrun.KillAll()`; stdio
  children spawn in their own process group, and the SDK terminates them
  (stdin close → SIGTERM → SIGKILL after 3s).

Polish (the "never stuck, always know why" pass):

- **Fail-fast calls** — a call to a failed/disabled server returns instantly
  with an actionable message (`/mcp <name> reconnect|enable`); a
  still-connecting server caps the wait at a 5s grace then returns "retry in
  a moment". No turn parks on a 30s startup timeout.
- **Did-you-mean** — `tools.Suggester` (installed by `Agent.SetMCPTools`)
  runs an early-exit Levenshtein over live tool names, so a stale/typo'd
  `mcp__` call gets `did you mean mcp__docs__greet?` instead of a dead end.
- **First-settle notes** — each server's first settle lands one transcript
  line (`⚡ mcp: docs ready (4 tools)` / `✗ mcp: x failed: …`); later
  transitions stay quiet.
- **Auto-reconnect** — a dropped session retries in the background with
  backoff (1s/2s/4s, cap 3), guarded against close/disable/dupes; manual
  `/mcp reconnect` stays unlimited.
- **Server instructions** — initialize-result instructions render into an
  `<mcp_instructions>` block appended to the system prompt every turn
  (alongside skills), tracking live sessions.
- **`loopy mcp test <name>`** — the doctor: connect + list + timing + tool
  names, stderr tail on failure, non-zero exit — CI-checkable `.mcp.json`.

Tests: `config_test.go` (claude/codex parsing incl. a real-world codex
config, merge precedence, discovery errors, tool-name round-trips),
`manager_test.go` (connect/call, error-as-output, structured+media
flattening, dead-server degradation, reconnect, parallel calls under `-race`,
ctx cancel mid-connect), `loop_test.go` (model→MCP→model round trip against
a fake provider; stale def on a dead server returns `"Error: …"` and the turn
completes), `selfhost_test.go` (`loopy mcp serve` end-to-end, gated on
`LOOPY_TEST_SELFHOST=1`), `tui/mcp_test.go` (status view, toggle persistence
round-trip).

## Process safety

`internal/tools/bashrun/bashrun.go` — every command the agent runs is tracked
in a process registry (`track`/`untrack`). On exit (`tui.Run` returning — quit,
`/quit`, or a signal), `KillAll()` SIGKILLs every tracked **process group** and
waits briefly for reaping, so an agent-started server or watcher never outlives
loopy.

The non-interactive path captures via explicit `StdoutPipe`/`StderrPipe` and
closes the read ends the moment the process exits, so a detached grandchild
(`nohup`, `sleep 30 &`, a daemonized server) holding the write end can't hang
the agent on pipe EOF. The interactive path runs in a PTY for sudo/ssh-style
prompts, killed after 15s of no input.

Tests: `killall_test.go` — `TestKillAllReapsChildren` (kills a live `sleep 60`),
`TestBackgroundGrandchildDoesNotHang`.

## Skills

`internal/skills/skills.go` — scans `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` (project) and
`~/.loopy/skills/` (user) for a name+description frontmatter block, injected
into the system prompt as an `<available_skills>` block. The model reads a
SKILL.md with its own read tool when relevant. Skills re-index every turn, so
new ones load without restarting.

**`/doctor` (alias `/context-doctor`)** — fresh-session context audit: every
automatic injection source with its estimated token cost (base system prompt,
skills block with the 5 biggest offenders, per-server MCP tool schemas, server
instructions, built-in tool schemas, conversation history, and actual session
spend once requests have run), a TOTAL line, and trim pointers. Built for
users arriving from heavier harnesses whose first call silently carries tens
of thousands of tokens of skill/MCP bloat. Tests: `tui/doctor_test.go`.

**Startup resource report** — first paint names what loopy loaded: `skills: N
loaded`, one `⚠` line per degraded skill (description over maxDesc → truncated
in the prompt) or unparseable SKILL.md (pi's [Skill conflicts] lesson — a
broken skill is never silent), and one `mcp:` line with per-server status
glyphs (`✓ N tools` / `✗` / `○ disabled` / `◌ connecting`). Skipped on resume.
Tests: `tui/startup_report_test.go` (warnings, MCP glyphs, silence when empty).

Installed: the `golang-*` skill set plus `i-have-adhd` (output-shaping for ADHD
readers; invoke with `/i-have-adhd`, off with "stop adhd mode").
